# CS50 AI
## Search & Optimization
- **degrees**: Graph search to find the shortest path between actors (BFS)
- **tictactoe**: Adversarial search using Minimax for optimal play

## Knowledge & Logic
- **knights**: Propositional logic and model checking to solve logic puzzles
- **minesweeper**: Logical inference with a knowledge base to identify mines and safe cells

## Uncertainty & Probability
- **heredity**: Bayesian inference to compute gene and trait probabilities
- **pagerank**: Probabilistic modeling of a random surfer to rank pages

## Learning
- **nim**: Reinforcement learning using Q-learning and self-play
- **shopping**: Supervised learning to predict purchasing behavior
- **traffic**: Deep learning (CNNs) for traffic sign image classification

## Language
- **parser**: Context-free grammars for sentence parsing
- **attention**: Attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of language input

## Constraint Satisfaction
- **crossword**: Constraint satisfaction with backtracking and heuristics
